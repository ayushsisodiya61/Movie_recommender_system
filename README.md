# Movie_recommender_system
Developed a movie recommender system that delivers personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and viewing history, utilizing collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn,SQL databases, and front-end libraries(StreamLit).
Algorithms: Implemented collaborative filtering (matrix factorization, nearest neighbors) and content-based filtering techniques, enhancing recommendation accuracy.
Hybrid System: Combined collaborative and content-based filtering methods to improve recommendations for new users and niche movies.
Data Processing: Processed and cleaned large movie datasets, such as MovieLens, to create a structured database of user ratings and movie metadata (genre, director, cast, etc.).
Model Optimization: Tuned hyperparameters and applied model evaluation techniques like RMSE and Precision@K to measure and optimize recommendation accuracy.
Deployment: Developed a Flask API to serve recommendations, enabling integration into web or mobile applications. Demonstrated scalability and user interactivity through dynamic front-end (optional).
